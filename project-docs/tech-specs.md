# Technical Specifications

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (React framework)
- **3D Library**: Three.js (via React Three Fiber)
- **Helpers**: React Three Drei (utility components)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

## Development Methods
- Component-based architecture
- Declarative 3D scene definition
- Hooks for state management and animations
- Suspense for asset loading
- TypeScript for type safety

## Coding Standards
- ESLint for code quality
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- React hooks linting rules
- Clear component naming conventions
- JSDoc comments for complex functions

## Database Design
- No database required for basic implementation
- For future enhancements, consider:
  - Firebase for simple data storage
  - MongoDB for more complex data requirements
  - Local storage for user preferences

## Performance Considerations
- Use of React Suspense for code splitting
- Optimize 3D geometries and materials
- Implement level of detail (LOD) for complex scenes
- Employ proper cleanup of Three.js resources
- Consider using React.memo for performance-critical components

## Security Considerations
- No sensitive data handled in basic implementation
- For future enhancements:
  - Implement proper authentication for user data
  - Sanitize user inputs if implementing interactive features
  - Use HTTPS for all communications

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js
- **Styling**: CSS Modules
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **API Layer**: Next.js API Routes
- **Testing**: 
  - **Unit Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
  - **Cross-Browser Testing**: Playwright
  - **Load Testing**: k6
  - **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Development Methodology

## Testing Strategy
### Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing
- Automated tests using Playwright
- Coverage across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- Mobile browser emulation (Chrome Mobile, Safari Mobile)
- Tablet device emulation

### Responsive Design Testing
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoint testing at key viewport sizes
- Element layout and visibility validation
- Interaction testing on touch devices

### Load Testing
- Performance testing with k6
- Multiple test scenarios:
  - Constant load testing (baseline performance)
  - Ramp testing (gradual traffic increase)
  - Spike testing (sudden traffic surges)
- Performance metrics tracking:
  - Response time metrics (p95, median)
  - Error rate thresholds
  - Throughput measurements

### Continuous Integration
- Automated test runs on code changes
- Separate jobs for different test categories
- Test result artifacts for analysis
- Configurable test environments

## Deployment Strategy
- Environment-based configurations
- Automated deployments via CI/CD
- Rollback capabilities
- Zero-downtime deployments
