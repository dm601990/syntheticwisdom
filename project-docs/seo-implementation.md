# SEO Implementation for Synthetic Wisdom

This document outlines the SEO implementation for the Synthetic Wisdom website, particularly focusing on the AI Toolkit section.

## Implemented SEO Features

### 1. Metadata and Title Tags

We've added comprehensive metadata to the toolkit page using Next.js Metadata API:

- **Title Tag**: Optimized with relevant keywords while maintaining readability
- **Meta Description**: Concise summary of the page content with keywords naturally integrated
- **Keywords**: Targeted keywords related to AI tools, models, and platforms
- **Open Graph Tags**: For better social media sharing
- **Twitter Card Tags**: For Twitter-specific preview cards

### 2. Sitemap Generation

A dynamic sitemap has been implemented to help search engines discover and index all pages:

- Automatically updates with the current date
- Prioritizes pages appropriately (home page gets highest priority)
- Supports future expansion for individual toolkit item pages

Location: `3d-environment/app/sitemap.ts`

### 3. Robots.txt

Added a robots.txt file to:
- Allow crawling of public pages
- Prevent crawling of API routes
- Point search engines to the sitemap
