# User Flow & Project Structure

## User Flow

### Main Navigation Paths
- Home → News Article → Return to Home
- Home → Category Filter → Filtered News Articles
- Home → Search → Search Results
- Home → AI Toolkit → Tool Details
- Home → Simulated Silliness → Simulation Experience

### User Interactions
- Click on article card to expand/view details
- Use category filters to narrow down content
- Search for specific topics or keywords
- Clear cache (admin function)
- Navigate between main sections

```

### Key Components
- `NewsCard`: Displays article information
- `CategoryFilter`: Handles category selection
- `SearchBar`: Provides search functionality
- `EnhancedCache`: Manages data caching

### Pages Structure
- `index.js`: Homepage with news grid
- `toolkit.js`: AI toolkit page
- `silliness.js`: Simulated silliness page
- `api/news.js`: News data API endpoint

### Testing Structure
- `playwright.config.ts`: Cross-browser and device testing configuration
- `tests/cross-browser/navigation.spec.ts`: Browser compatibility tests
- `tests/responsive/responsive.spec.ts`: Mobile and tablet responsiveness tests
- `tests/load-testing/load-test.js`: Performance testing scripts
- `.github/workflows/testing.yml`: CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Data Flow

### News Data Flow
1. User requests news articles
2. System checks EnhancedCache for data
3. If cached and valid, returns cached data
4. If not cached or expired, fetches from API
5. Processes data (adds read time, etc.)
6. Stores in cache for future requests
7. Returns data to user interface

### Category Filtering Flow
1. User selects category filter
2. System filters cached news data by category
3. UI updates to show filtered articles
4. Read times are displayed for each article

### Search Flow
1. User enters search query
2. System filters news data by query
3. Results are sorted by relevance
4. UI updates to display matching articles

## Testing Flow

### Development Testing Cycle
1. Developer implements new feature
2. Unit tests verify component behavior
3. Cross-browser tests check compatibility
4. Responsive tests verify mobile experience
5. Load tests assess performance impact
6. Code is pushed to repository

### CI/CD Testing Pipeline
1. Code changes trigger GitHub Actions workflow
2. Cross-browser tests run on multiple engines
3. Responsive design tests verify layout
4. Performance tests validate load handling
5. Test results are stored as artifacts
6. Deployment proceeds if all tests pass

## User Journey
1. User navigates to the application URL
2. The 3D environment loads with a rotating cube
3. User can interact with the 3D scene:
   - Click and drag to rotate the view
   - Scroll to zoom in/out
   - Right-click and drag to pan (optional)
4. Additional UI elements can be added for specific interactions

## Data Flow
1. Initial page load triggers React component mounting
2. React Three Fiber sets up the Three.js renderer, scene, and camera
3. Scene component mounts with 3D objects
4. Animation loop begins for continuous rendering
5. User interactions (mouse/touch) are captured and translated into camera movements

## Component Architecture
- **Layout**: Provides the base HTML structure
- **HomePage**: Main component that hosts the Canvas
- **Canvas**: React Three Fiber container for 3D content
- **Scene**: Container for 3D objects and lighting
- **Individual 3D Objects**: Mesh components for various objects

## Potential Extensions
- Add a UI overlay for controls and information
- Implement loading screens for model importing
- Add post-processing effects for visual enhancement
- Create an object management system for complex scenes
